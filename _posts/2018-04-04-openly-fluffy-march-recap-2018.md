Openly Fluffy March 2018 Recap

Happy April!

It's finally warming up a bit. Are you excited for this month? What are your goals, hopes, and dreams this month? Here is mine for this stream of ours: Conversation.
Since the start of this year, it has been wonderful focusing on getting to know everyone better and have been constantly amazed at how diverse of a community we are and how many different stories and thoughts we have. And so while we won't do away with the short and sweet "How are you?" conversations, I would also like to take it a step further and dive deeper into longer conversations and explore our inner beauty.

#### Fluff Thoughts ####

This time, I would like to talk here about some of the times in the past month that I feel like I've let you all down and where I think I still need to improve as a streamer.

I know that last month I said the additional time that this new stream schedule would give me would let me fix up and re-launch the Instafluff app but I ended up prioritizing other things first and progress on it fell by the wayside so I'm sorry. Bingo is still coming back, although I'm not exactly sure how soon. I am hopeful it will be fixed up by summer time.

We've also had a few trolls in our chat now during stream and recently one of them started doing "detective work" into one member that had kindly joined our stream and started posting some personal info into chat and I feel I should have put a stop to it much quicker. To the member and to all of you, I'm really sorry about that and thank you, Amaro, for stepping in as a mod. This kind of trolling will be high on my radar from now on as well.

Lastly, we regularly had new features like different chat commands and things like the Fluff Boss and Okay/Nokay in the past but haven't had one in over a month, partially due to some of the behind-the-scenes things I have been working on. (I'll talk about these next!) There will be more new things soon, I promise! In the meantime, if you have any ideas or things you would like to see, please send them my way!

#### Plans ####

We've been sticking to a theme of similiar games over the past month with always having Tomb Raider on Thursdays and Pokemon on Fridays. Do you like this consistency or would you prefer we mix it up a lot more? Wednesdays have been our sort of wildcard days and it seems to work for me but I would love to hear your thoughts.

As for content itself, I would really like to start shifting away from just having video games and so a Disney/Marvel Crochet stream is on the schedule and more to come soon! I'm struggling with how to balance between games and creative streams though so for now, it seems like Wednesdays would be the day for them if we're not playing a game. What do you think?
Also... would anyone be interested in a music stream?

#### Asks ####

I don't really have any specific asks this month but would like to take this chance to thank you all so much for choosing to spend your precious time with me. It means so much to me that you keep coming back and supporting this comfy little corner of Twitch. Thank you and I hope we can keep making this space a welcoming place for everyone, together.

#### Summary ####

* This Month's Goal: Conversation
* Self-reflection: Still a lot of room for improvement as a streamer
* Let's keep making this space a welcoming place!

If I could, I would send you the biggest and fluffiest hugs. Thank you again so so much for everything this past month.

Stay Comfy,

***Instafluff***
