Openly Fluffy August/September 2018 Recap

Hello hello! Are these updates better late than never? We did and changed a lot in the past two months. We're doing new things but still trying to be the same Comfy Corner as ever. Thank you for being a part of what makes our place comfy.

#### Fluff Thoughts ####

In trying to shift more towards creative streams and doing something more unique, 

- Doubled up on Coding Cafe
- Built 12 open-source projects (17 total)
- Made new friends & Interviewed on Front Page
- Passed 1000 followers, and 100 subs
- Chat Credits System
- Launched ChatTranslator Bot
- Wrote stories with MadLibby
- Played Chat Pachinko Marbles
- Made BongoCat Play along to music
- Chat Barista
- Dino Points
- Analyzed Gun Violence Data
- Sentiment Calculator
- Completed Shadow of the Tomb Raider
- Mug Recipes
Plans:
- Make credits automatic per stream
- In October, our theme will be AI
- TwitchCon end of Month



#### Plans ####

We recently started branding our coding streams as the Coding Cafe but it is still in early stages. Let's take it further in the coming weeks to build out our cafe with more scene design and construction and adding to our chatbot as well. Any and all ideas would be great, like having those ambient cafe sounds. Virtual coffee orders perhaps..?

Another plan in the works is to introduce weekly Masterclass watching sessions, which we are still waiting from Twitch for our Comfy Fund to actually come in but it should be ready any day now.

Lastly, to make our stream a place we really feel like we've built together, I want to try to make sure each of us get recognized for what we do and/or add for/to it. One of the ways I want to do this is to have everyone chatting during our coding streams be included in the credits of the open-source code that we publish afterwards. Let's build that system ASAP!

#### Asks ####

There are no real asks this month. I just appreciate every one of you for being part of our community and hope that you like the changes we have been making!

#### Summary ####

* Thank you to our moderators and regulars!
* Feedback please! Do you like the new changes or do you want more games?
* More on-stream Coding Cafe branding coming soon
* Masterclass watching sessions soon!

Thank you again for being a lovely person in our Comfy Corner. I am excited to see where we can take our stream together in the next year!

Stay Comfy,
